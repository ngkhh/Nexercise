# Nexercise

This is the README file for the Nexercise GitHub project. Nexercise is a project focused on utilizing MQTT communication and ESP8266 microcontrollers to create an interactive exercise game. This document provides information on how to set up and use the project, as well as relevant links and resources.

## Todo 
The main goals of the project are as follows:
- Complete Bill of Materials (BOM) (✔️)
- Improve the project's PowerPoint presentation (❌)
- Start writing the script for the project (ChatGPT)
- Prepare for a comprehensive presentation (Rewrite ChatGPT script, and improve better)

## Current Challenges
The project currently faces the following challenges:
- ~Laziness~
- ~Lack of motivation~
- Skill issue (✔️)

## Work in Progress
The team is currently working on the following tasks:
- ~Implementing MQTT on ESP8266 microcontrollers~
- Displaying a randomized alphabet on a dot matrix
- Integrating two buttons representing "W" and "M"
- Designing a schematic, PCB, and case for the project (✔️)

## Planned Features
The following features are planned for future development:
- ~Connecting four ESP8266 microcontrollers using MQTT~ (Not important + Not urgent)
- Combining the buttons and dot matrix to create a game
